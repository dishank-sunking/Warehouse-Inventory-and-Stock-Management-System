# Warehouse Inventory and Stock Management System

A secure, role-based backend system for managing warehouse products, stock operations, and audit history using a clean layered architecture.
---

## Problem Statement

The retail company currently tracks warehouse inventory manually, leading to:

- Stock count inaccuracies
- No accountability for stock changes
- Lack of audit history
- Poor visibility across roles

This system digitizes and controls all product and stock operations with full audit tracking.

## System Architecture

The system follows a layered clean architecture:

Client  
↓  
Controller Layer (REST APIs)  
↓  
Service Layer (Business Logic)  
↓  
Repository Layer (JPA)  
↓  
MySQL Database

| `200 OK` | Successful read or update |
| `201 Created` | Resource successfully created |
| `400 Bad Request` | Invalid input — missing fields, wrong types |
| `401 Unauthorized` | Missing or invalid JWT token |
| `403 Forbidden` | Token valid but role lacks permission |
| `404 Not Found` | Resource does not exist |
| `409 Conflict` | Duplicate resource or idempotency key already used |

# Setup & Running the Application

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed:

- Java 17+
- Maven 3.8+
- Docker
- Docker Compose

---

## Step 1: Start Database Using Docker

From the project root directory:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This will:

- Start MySQL container
- Create required database
- Expose configured ports
- Prepare environment for the Inventory application

To verify containers:

```bash
docker ps
```

To stop containers:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

---

## Step 2: Run Inventory Application

After Docker services are running, start the Spring Boot application.

### Option A: Using Maven

```bash
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### Option B: Run Packaged JAR

Build the project:

```bash
mvn clean package
```

Run the generated JAR:

```bash
java -jar target/inventory-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

---

## Application Access

Application URL:

```
http://localhost:8080
```

Base API URL:

```
http://localhost:8080/api/v1
```

---

# Running Tests

## Run All Tests

```bash
mvn test
```

## Run Only StockService Tests

```bash
mvn -Dtest=StockServiceTest test
```

This runs only the `StockServiceTest` class.

---

#  Design Decisions

- JWT for stateless authentication
- Append-only StockMovement for audit integrity
- Stock quantity stored in Product for performance
- Role-based middleware authorization
- Layered architecture for maintainability

---

# Assumptions

- Single warehouse system
- No ERP integration
- Admin-managed users
- Stock stored as running total
